i wont repeat the application but i am sure you get the drift of the rmarkdown, to allow easier report writing for our work:

eg

1. (Essential to the job)
Demonstrable experience of working with extended reality technologies; *  

1.	For Leeds Hospitals Charity (LHC) I created a VR and PC Non-technical skills medical training application. See attached document “NTS Summary Report” for more details- which was the report submitted to the LHC December 2022. 

This resource is called an immersive Reusable Learning Object (iRLO). The design and development process followed a well- evidenced and effective framework called the ASPIRE framework. I performed everything from recordings and assets to the unity app, experimental setup and analysis, reporting/publishing etc. 
<br>

2.	I spent 5 years on my PhD which involved how surgical trainees deploy their attention in virtual environments to cues relating to patient safety. I made a VR app in Unreal, and combined expert insight to assess and train undergraduate ODP trainees.

<br>

3.	I worked on the CoViRR (Co-Creation of Virtual Reality Reusable E-Resources for European Healthcare Education) ERASMUS+ strategic partnership which co-created virtual reality reusable e-resources promoting innovative practices in digital era, by supporting current curricula and fostering open education. CoViRR intervened where current digital health training still lacks in solving many issue.

----i can add graphs and do statistical analyses etc. take a look at https://cepeh-analytics.netlify.app/ that i am just creating, and https://helm-analytics.netlify.app/ which i am analysing 100,000+ data
