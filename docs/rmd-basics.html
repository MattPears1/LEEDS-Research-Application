<p>When participants were asked the amount of time they have used a chatbot in any
form or subject, 23 stated they had never used a chatbot. Further, 19/42 stated having used a chatbot at least once for between 0-4 hours of use in total. These are likely commercial/website- based assistant chatbots however there are some medical/healthcare resources known to be used in anatomy and/or patient interactions.
One individual had spent much longer time with usage- this was the mature student.</p>

<p>In short, approximately 50% had never used a chatbot, and 45% had used a chatbot, at some period over the years, for a short period of time.</p>

Figure 2.1: Chatbot Usage History- Pre
</p>
</div>
<p>Most learners use books or online books as resources. They may use multiple sources however they were asked to note the primary source. Only 6 stated their primary sources were <em>Online videos/interactive materials</em> which includes such tools as chatbots.</p>
<p>The first boxplot (<a href="rmd-basics.html#fig:Boxplotsplits2">2.1</a>) shows learners perceptions of easy of use of mobile app and other educational mobile resources</p>
<p>(<a href="#fig:BoxplotUsefulPre"><strong>??</strong></a>) shows the opinions of all participants on the usefulness of chatbots. Many had not had experience with them yet had positive rating. This positive opinions of chatbots may be from colleagues, friends, media, tutors, or other social information of the benefits in healthcare education.
Around 25% were neutral or disagreed that healthcare chatbots were useful.</p>
<p><em>The participants then used the 4 chatbots, and completed the post-usage survey after each chatbot. Pre-and post differences are as followed:</em>
## Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ)</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> CUQ Calculation tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cuq-calculation-tool"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>The CUQ was developed by researchers at Ulster University, <a href="a%3C%20href=" title="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/research/topic/computer-science/artificial-intelligence/projects/cuq%22">Link</a> and as the calculation can be complex, a dedicated calculation tool has
been created.</p>

<p>Although the design and development was similar, each chatbot CUQ score was calculated to understand how the topic content may affect usability:</p>
<p>The breakdown of the chatbots was:
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki CUQ score = 63/100
CYENS Centre of Excellence CUQ score = 67/100
Karolinska Institute CUQ score = 63/100
University of Nottingham CUQ score = 68/100</p>
<p>The score for all 3 chatbots grouped was 65/100, This scoring system was designed to be comparable to SUS and may be freely used alongside it, or in combination with other usability metrics. There has been evidence of correlation of 76% between the CUQ and SUS therefore we expect the SUS scored to be between 48.75 and 81%. We believe the CUQ has the highest validity in the measures used towards the concepts of interest on this study.</p>

<p>The figure above, (<a href="rmd-basics.html#fig:Boxplotsplits6">2.3</a>) shows the ratings by participants of the CEPEH Chatbots to provide them with the necessary course information. This is a integral element in learners’ motivational and educational choices to reuse the learning resources. As previously described, the trust of the information is also a factor in these responses.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="_main_files/figure-html/Boxplotsplits7-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>There was mixed results for the chatbot used being realistic and
engaging. This question has two descriptive terms however based on the
other results we understand that the chatbots’ NLP logic, or ability to
respond required improvement to be more ‘smooth’ in replying. The
primary limitation was found in the ‘robotic’ interactions(See Figure
10). This was investigated further in the ‘Text Mining’ and ‘Sentiment
Analysis’ sections.</p>
<p><img src="_main_files/figure-html/Boxplotsplits8-1.png" width="672"><em>The chatbot seemed too robotic</em> results had the largest mix of responses, and for all 4 chatbots evaluated. The University of Nottingham Cybersecurity chatbot had more deterministic pathways with exploitation of the NLP modelling to provide illusion of realism. This may explain why there was less agreement. However, Neutrality and/or agreement was not desired.</p>
<p>The CYENS medical patient chatbot had more complex pathways of interactions,</p>

<p><em>Note= The amount of ‘agreement’ is defined as the addition of ‘Agree’

<p>The SUS score should consist of 10 items. However, some SUS questions
were improved upon by 1 or more CUQ questions, specifically to this
Chatbot study. The SUS results would be overshadowed by the CUQ scores,
expect 2 that did not have cross-over. The two questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to use the CEPEH chatbot I tested, more frequently
(SUS1)(post)</li>
<li>I felt confident using the CEPEH chatbot (SUS2)(post)</li>
</ul>
<p>This meant the score of the SUS was not created, however the CUQ score
better represented the Learners’ perceptions of the CEPEH chatbot in
terms of feasibility of reuse and acceptability in healthcare curricula.</p>

were Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Easy of Use (PEU)</p>

</ol>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>The scores as a percentage of agreement, were calculated by averaging
the subsets and interpreted as:</p>
<p>Before using the CEPEH chatbots, there was 66% (2.2/5) agreement for the
Perceived Usefulness of chatbots in healthcare education, and after 48%
(2.6/5) agreed.</p>
<p>Before using the CEPEH chatbots, there was 64% (2.3) agreement for
Perceived Ease of Use of chatbots in healthcare education, and after 51%
(2.56) agreed.</p>
<p>The justification for this may be due to being early versions of
applications with limited functionality and functions which can be
difficult for user to experience the intended further range of features
and learning exercises.</p>

<p>After using the CEPEH chatbots, majority of participants stated they
would reuse the chatbots. However, there was 6 counts of <em>disagree</em> or
<em>strongly disagree</em> for all 4 chatbots. Further, there were 17 counts of
neutral in reuse, which was approximately 4 participants per chatbot
(see (<a href="rmd-basics.html#fig:Boxplotsplits4">2.5</a>).</p>
