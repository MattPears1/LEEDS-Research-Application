Most learners use books or online books as resources. Of course, they
may use multiple sources however they were asked to note the primary
source. Only 6 stated their primary sources were <em>Online
videos/interactive materials</em> which includes such tools as chatbots.</p>

<p>This can be supported when asked the amount of time participants have
used a chatbot- in any form or subject: 23 stated they had never used a
chatbot, being educational or not. 2 individuals had spent what would be
extensive time with usage- these were the Learning Technologist and

<p>The CUQ was developed by researchers at Ulster University (see) {&lt;a

<p>Please download the CEPEH CUQ calculation tool which has all of the data entered, so you can see the CEPEH CUQ scoring.</p>

So Figure @ref(fig:cuq image) is <a href="#fig:cuq%20image">this image</a>.</p>
<p>The score for all 3 chatbots grouped was 65.2/100,
This scoring system was designed to be comparable to SUS and may be
freely used alongside it, or in combination with other usability
metrics. There has been evidence of correlation of 76% between the CUQ
and SUS therefore we expect the SUS scored to be between 48.75 and 81%.
We believe the CUQ has more validity towards measuring the concepts of
interest on this study.</p>

<p><em>Note= The amount of ‘agreement’ is defined as the addition of ‘Agree’
and ‘Strongly agree’ responses.</em></p>
<p>The SUS score should consist of 10 items. However, some SUS questions
were improved upon by 1 or more CUQ questions, specifically to this
Chatbot study. The SUS results would be overshadowed by the CUQ scores,
expect 2 that did not have cross-over. The two questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to use the CEPEH chatbot I tested, more frequently
(SUS1)(post)</li>
<li>I felt confident using the CEPEH chatbot (SUS2)(post)</li>
</ul>
<p>This meant the score of the SUS was not created, however the CUQ score
better represented the Learners’ perceptions of the CEPEH chatbot in
terms of feasibility of reuse and acceptability in healthcare curricula.</p>

<p>The TAM had 3 sections (Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Intention
of Use). Ease of Use results showed significant increases in Users’
usage with each Chatbot. Perceived Usefulness: There were not
significant findings for the Perceived usefulness. The justification for
this may be due to being early versions of applications with limited
functionality and functions which can be difficult for user to
experience the intended further range of features and learning
exercises.</p>
<p>Intention of Use: For users’ intentions to use within their course, the
result of the Mann-Whitney U test was not significant, U = , z = , p = .
in their intentions before use (m=xx, mode=xx) compared to after (m=xx,
mode=x), however there was improvement therefore the chatbots may have
more benefit than expected by students.</p>
