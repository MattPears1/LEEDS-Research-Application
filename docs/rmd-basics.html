<p>When participants were asked the amount of time they have used a chatbot
in any form or subject, 23 stated they had never used a chatbot.
Further, 19/42 stated having used a chatbot at least once for between
0-4 hours of use in total. These are likely commercial/website- based
assistant chatbots however there are some medical/healthcare resources
known to be used in anatomy and/or patient interactions. One individual
had spent much longer time with usage- this was the mature student.</p>

<p>In short, approximately 50% had never used a chatbot, and 45% had used a
chatbot, at some period over the years, for a short period of time.</p>
<p>Most learners use books or online books as resources. They may use multiple sources however they were asked to note the primary source. Only 6 stated their primary sources were <em>Online videos/interactive materials</em> which includes such tools as chatbots.</p>

<li>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki CUQ score = 63/100</li>
<li>CYENS Centre of Excellence CUQ score = 67/100</li>
<li>Karolinska Institute CUQ score = 63/100</li>

<p><em>Note= The amount of ‘agreement’ is defined as the addition of ‘Agree’

<p>The SUS score should consist of 10 items. However, some SUS questions were improved upon by 1 or more CUQ questions, specifically to this Chatbot study. The SUS results would be obscured by the CUQ scores, expect 2 that did not have cross-over. The two questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I would like to use the CEPEH chatbot I tested, more frequently</p></li>
<li><p>I felt confident using the CEPEH chatbot</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This meant the score of the SUS was not created, however the CUQ score better represented the Learners’ perceptions of the CEPEH chatbot in terms of feasibility of use and acceptability in healthcare curricula.</p>

<p>The TAM questions were analysed according to their subsets. The subsets
were Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)</p>
<p>The questions were-</p>
<p>Perceived Usefulness (PU):
1. Using CEPEH chatbots would enable me to accomplish tasks more
quickly
2. Using CEPEH chatbots would increase performance
3. Using CEPEH chatbots would increase my productivity
4. I would find CEPEH chatbots useful on my course</p>
<p>Perceived Ease of Use (PEU):
5. Learning to use CEPEH chatbots would be easy to me
6. It would be easy for me to be skilful at using CEPEH chatbots
7. My interactions with CEPEH chatbots would be clear and understandable
8. I would find CEPEH chatbots easy to use</p>
<p>The scores as a percentage of agreement, were calculated by averaging the subsets and interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before using the CEPEH chatbots, there was 66% (2.2/5) agreement for the Perceived Usefulness of chatbots in healthcare education, and after 48% (2.6/5) agreed.</p></li>
<li><p>Before using the CEPEH chatbots, there was 64% (2.3) agreement for Perceived Ease of Use of chatbots in healthcare education, and after 51% (2.56) agreed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The justification for this may be due to being early versions of applications with limited functionality and functions which can be difficult for user to experience the intended further range of features and learning exercises.</p>

<p><em>The chatbot seemed too robotic</em> results had the largest mix of
responses, and for all 4 chatbots evaluated. The University of
Nottingham Cybersecurity chatbot had more deterministic pathways with
exploitation of the NLP modelling to provide illusion of realism. This
may explain why there was less agreement. However, Neutrality and/or
agreement was not desired.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="_main_files/figure-html/Boxplot%20personality-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>There were mixed results for the chatbot used being realistic and engaging. This question has two descriptive terms however based on the other results we understand that the chatbots’ NLP logic, or ability to respond required improvement to be more ‘smooth’ in replying. The primary limitation was found in the ‘robotic’ interactions (See Figure x). This was
investigated further in the ‘Text Mining’ and ‘Sentiment Analysis’ sections.</p>

<p>Paired t-test involves matching the same participants on a variable before intervention with, ideally, the equal measure of variable after intervention. For this study, we used several metrics from the various questionnaires to facilitate pre-post comparisons. The CUQ was only asked after chatbot usage, however most other questions were able to have a pre-post comparison.</p>
<p>Importantly, there is value in the modes which indicate majority consensus, rather than mean driven t-tests. Being an initial single session with technical orientation for Users as well as practical usage, there is high change that a minority will experience technical or functional problems. Although the majority may benefit, the measures from this minority can significantly impact the measures. For example, if a sample of 42 have the results 5/5 (27), 4/5 (11), and 1/5 (5), the mode and median are 5 however the mean is 4.38. This can affect parametric or non-parametric results that infer equal experience from participant. We are not overlooking participants but factoring in their experiences as a minority and assessing their results in other ways- i.e., the focus group discussions. This better reflects each participants experience and the accuracy of efficacy of the chatbots.
Because of the experimental set-up and the 4 different chatbots, the meaning of the t-tests has small power and effect size. We intended for all metrics to improve, but to have significant findings with the setup does not provide much more information in addition to increased means/scores. We performed paired t-tests, however many paired samples had significant Shapiro-Wilk results indicating the normality assumption were violated. The test is robust to violations, and the same participants are being tested over Time, rather than different participants. This also indicated that the meaning of the Wilcoxon has limited strength.</p>

<p>The results showed there were no significant differences in these comparisons. For each comparison the results were:</p>
<p>• Confidence- t(24) = -0.35, <strong>p = .731</strong> (prem=1.96, postm=2.04)</p>
<p>• Daily usefulness- V = 48.50, z = -0.27, <strong>p = .790</strong> (prem=2.04, postm=2.12)</p>
<p>• Increasing achievements- t(24) = -0.18, <strong>p = .857</strong> (prem=2.28, postm=2.32)</p>
<p>• Accomplish tasks quickly- V = 36.00, z = -0.25, <strong>p = .805</strong> (prem=2.12, postm=2.16)</p>
<p>• Increased productivity- V = 96.00, z = -1.51, <strong>p = .131</strong> (prem=2.6, postm=2.24)</p>
<p>• Ease of use- V = 72.00, z = -1.32, <strong>p = .186</strong> (prem=2.36, postm=2.12)</p>
<p>• Clear and understandable interactions- V = 101.50, z = -1.82, <strong>p = .068</strong> (prem=2.2, postm=2.61)</p>
<p>• Use chatbots more frequently- t(24) = 0.45, <strong>p = .657</strong> (prem=2.2, postm=2.08)</p>
<p>As predicted, the sensitivity of the t-test meant Wilcoxon test was more appropriate for some measures. The results show minor increases in means for most, but minor decreases in others. These results have high standard deviations which are from a minority of participants scoring low, and explored in the focus group discussions.</p>

After using the CEPEH chatbots, majority of participants stated they
would reuse the chatbots. However, there was 6 counts of <em>disagree</em> or
<em>strongly disagree</em> for all 4 chatbots. Further, there were 17 counts of
neutral in reuse, which was approximately 4 participants per chatbot
(see (<a href="rmd-basics.html#fig:Boxplotsplits4">2.12</a>).</p>

<p>For CYENS, even though the knowledge of the topic was not perceived to
improve by some participants, this box plot shows how 34/42 stated they
would reuse the chatbot developed by CYENS.

<p>There was only 1 ‘Strongly Disagree’ response. The agreement options
counted for the majority of the data.
Repeated Measures t-test, aka paired t-test (before and after
measurements)

<p>This t-test compares confident using mobile chatbots before and after
CEPEH chatbot usage.</p>
