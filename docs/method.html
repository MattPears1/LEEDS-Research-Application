<p>This dataset had 14 males and 28 females therefore a total of 42 participants.
It was a repeated measure design whereby each participant used the 4 chatbots developed by the CEPEH team.
Therefore, there are 42 points of data in the condition before testing, and 126 data points after testing the chatbots- for a total of 168 row of data, 5 per participant.
There were 78 questions asked in total, therefore the full dataset has over 4000 cells recorded.</p>
<p>There were 22 females and 7 males from Greece.
There were 3 females and 4 males from Cyprus.
There were 2 females and 2 males from Sweden,
and there were 2 participants from the United Kingdom (see(<a href="method.html#fig:location1">1.1</a>).</p>

<p>The majority 36 participants, were student, with 3 being learning technologists, 2 were lecturers, and 1 was a doctor.
Although there could be a difference in these groups, the design was within- groups therefore each participants pre-usage metrics were the comparative control data, and participant differences did not affect the evaluation.</p>

</h2>
<p>For each resource created by the Partners, the same experimental methodology was followed.
For each resource created by partners, students performed a study within an online or face to face workshop or course.
Student participants joined from Greece, Cyprus, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
A repeated measures design was used as the same group measures were taken before and after usage of the chatbots.
They were recruited via staff members in the CEPEH group.</p>
<p>Participants were asked prior to the study if they agree to participate, providing them with a PIS form.
Participants had the opportunity to discuss with the research team prior to the study and before consent is given.
Then, participants used the chatbot resources independently and technical support was provided.
Finally, post-intervention measures were recorded.</p>
<p>Some of the participants were invited to participate in Focus Group Discussions (FGD), and each FGD lasted between 15 to 25 minutes, with 5-10 participants.
Participants were asked if they would like to be informed of the findings of the study.</p>

<p>The data captured from the participants were their initials and numerical day of birth, used as anonymous identifier for pre-post analysis.
Their institution was captured (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, CYENS Centre of Excellent, Karolinska Institute, and The University of Nottingham), and Sex (Male/Female/Other).</p>
<p>Before any interaction with the learning resources, various perceptions of chatbot such as confidence and easy of use, usefulness, Influence from others, and current learning resources (videos, textbooks, Google, friends etc), were captured.
Descriptive data was produced alongside repeated measures t-tests.
Repeated measures t-tests were the appropriate test to use as this explores differences between groups, there were no covariates and we did not have several dependant variables.
There was one Independent factor being Chatbot use having 2 levels (pre/post).
There were 3 chatbots therefore there was option for ANOVA to determine where differences lie if statistical differences were found however this was not wholly appropriate for the data type and not necessary for pre-post comparison.</p>
<p>## Materials and Measures</p>
<p>The measures used fit within a newly developed Chatbot Evaluation Framework- which takes the best measures of 5 previous frameworks.
Denecke and Warren ​[2]​ derived several quality dimensions and attributes from previous chatbot literature.
They formed six perspectives from their review of articles and mobile health applications.</p>
<p>These six perspectives were: 1) Task-oriented, 2) Artificial intelligence, 3) System quality perspective, 4) Linguistic perspective, 5) UX Perspective, 6) Healthcare quality perspective.</p>
<p>To capture these perspectives, we used several validated materials that can distinguish these elements of the CEPEH chatbots.</p>
<div id="chatbot-usability-questionnaire-cuq" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chatbot-usability-questionnaire-cuq"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) ​[4]​ is a new questionnaire specifically designed for measuring the usability of chatbots by an interdisciplinary team from the Ulster University.
CUQ can be used alongside the prevalent System Usability Scale Score (SUS) ​[5]​.
Multiple metrics are more appropriate when measuring usability of chatbots ​[6]​ therefore a combination of two scores can provide an all-inclusive overview.</p>

<div id="utaut2-unified-theory-of-acceptance-and-use-of-technology" class="section level3" number="1.3.2">

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#utaut2-unified-theory-of-acceptance-and-use-of-technology"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The underpinning theory of the UTAUT2 is that there are four key constructs to the intentions of using technology based resources: 1) performance expectancy, 2) effort expectancy, 3) social influence, and 4) enabling conditions.</p>
<p>The TAM and the UTAUT2 have cross over in measuring technology acceptance, however the UTAUT2 has more applied probing questions.
Few studies exist that use technology acceptance theories for the intention to use products that explicitly incorporate AI.
A recent extension of the UTAUT2 model added five (health, convenience comfort, sustainability, safety, security, and personal innovativeness) additional influencing factors to accommodate for AI [7].
This can be used for products in either health, household use, or mobility and can help to explain behavioural intention and use behaviour of chatbots.</p>
</div>
<div id="system-usability-scale" class="section level3" number="1.3.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> System Usability Scale<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#system-usability-scale"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used [10] and is a widely used and adopted usability questionnaire.
It is popular due to its unbiased and agnostic properties, a non proprietary, and a quick scale of 10 questions. However, as there are the CUQ and parts of the UTAUT2 we have selected only 2 questions which do not cross-over with the other measures. These are improtant statements however and good indicators of usability when assessed with the other results.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Computer Self-Efficacy Scale Tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computer-self-efficacy-scale-tool"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The 10 question CSEST is based on the 32-item questionnaire by Murphy, Coover, and Owen (1989). It can be adapted for any technology and we have selected only a few pertinent questions. Participants are asked to think about using the CEPEH chatbots and answer that they would use the chatbots if I had never used a product like it before; If they could call someone for help if I got stuck, or if someone showed them how to do it first, and other similar usage questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="technology-acceptance-model-tam" class="section level3" number="1.3.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#technology-acceptance-model-tam"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [1] was specifically developed with the primary aim of identifying the determinants involved in computer acceptance in general; secondly, to examine a variety of information technology usage behaviours; and thirdly, to provide a parsimonious theoretical explanatory model.</p>
<p>TAM suggests that attitude would be a direct predictor of the intention to use technology, which in turn would predict the actual usage of the technology.
The only modification to the nine sub-scales of the questionnaire consists of applying the items to the context of chatbots.
All the items, except those measuring attitudes, utilize a seven-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” with a middle neutral point [2].</p>
<p>The nine sub-scales of the questionnaire:</p>
<p>• Ease of use of chatbots
• Perceived usefulness of chatbots
• Intention of use.
• Attitude toward usage of chatbots.
• Perception of personal efficacy to use a chatbot resource.
• Perception of external control toward chatbots.
• Anxiety toward chatbot use.
• Intrinsic motivation to use chatbot resources.
• Perceived costs of chatbots.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.6</span> Qualitative Measure- Focus Group Discussions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#qualitative-measure--focus-group-discussions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Focus groups are a pervasive means of market research and provides credible acceptance evaluators regarding the penetration that a product or service will have on a target demographic.Focus groups are a form of qualitative research consisting of interviews or structured discussions, in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging.</p>
<p>Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.During this process, the researcher either takes notes or records the vital points he or she is getting from the group.
Researchers select members of the focus group carefully for effective and authoritative responses.Relevant stakeholders, then, can use the information collected through focus groups to receive insights on a specific product, issue, or topic focus [7].</p>
<p>A series of short focus group sessions identified the feasibility of CEPEH resources for formal curricular integration.These sessions, spanning no more than 1-1.5 hours and consisting of no more than 5-7 persons each explored all axes of curricular integration such as accessibility in the classroom, use case scenarios, technology requirements for curricular integration etc.These axes were formalized by the research team, in each evaluation site, to consider the curricular details of each institution.</p>
