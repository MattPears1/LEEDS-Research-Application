<p>This dataset had 14 males and 28 females therefore a total of 42 participants.
It was a repeated measure design whereby each participant used the 4 chatbots developed by the CEPEH team.
Therefore, there are 42 points of data in the condition before testing, and 126 data points after testing the 4 chatbots- for a total of 168 row of data, 5 per participant. There were 78 questions asked in total, therefore the full dataset has over 4000 cells recorded.</p>
<p>There were 22 females and 6 males from Greece.
There were 3 females and 4 males from Cyprus.
There were 2 females and 2 males from Sweden.</p>
<p>6 participants differed from the majority (33) who were student, as 3 were learning technologists, 2 were lecturers, and 1 was a doctor. Although there could be a difference in these groups, the design was within- groups therefore each participants pre-usage metrics were the comparative control data, and participant differences cannot affect the evaluation.</p>

</h2>
<p>For each resource created by the Partners, the same experimental methodology was followed. For each resource created by partners, students performed a study within an online or face to face workshop or course. Student participants joined from Greece, Cyprus, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
A repeated measures design was used as the same group measures were taken before and after usage of the chatbots. They were recruited via staff members in the CEPEH group.</p>
<p>Participants were asked prior to the study if they agree to participate, providing them with a PIS form.
Participants had the opportunity to discuss with the research team prior to the study and before consent is given. Then, participants used the chatbot resources independently and technical support was provided. Finally, post-intervention measures were recorded.</p>
<p>Some of the participants were invited to participate in Focus Group Discussions (FGD), and each FGD lasted between 15 to 25 minutes, with 5-10 participants. Participants were asked if they would like to be informed of the findings of the study.</p>

<p>The data captured from the participants were their initials and numerical day of birth, used as anonymous identifier for pre-post analysis. Their institution was captured (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, CYENS Centre of Excellent, Karolinska Institute, and The University of Nottingham), and Sex (Male/Female/Other).</p>
<p>Before any interaction with the learning resources, various perceptions of chatbot such as confidence and easy of use, usefulness, Influence from others, and current learning resources (videos, textbooks, Google, friends etc), were captured. Descriptive data was produced alongside repeated measures t-tests. Repeated measures t-tests were the appropriate test to use as this explores differences between groups, there were no covariates and we did not have several dependant variables. There was one Independent factor being Chatbot use having 2 levels (pre/post). There were 3 chatbots therefore there was option for ANOVA to determine where differences lie if statistical differences were found however this was not wholly appropriate for the data type and not necessary for pre-post comparison.</p>

<p>The measures used fit within a newly developed Chatbot Evaluation Framework- which takes the best measures of 5 previous frameworks. Denecke and Warren ​[2]​ derived several quality dimensions and attributes from previous chatbot literature. They formed six perspectives from their review of articles and mobile health applications.</p>
<p>These six perspectives were: 1) Task-oriented, 2) Artificial intelligence, 3) System quality perspective, 4) Linguistic perspective, 5) UX Perspective, 6) Healthcare quality perspective.</p>
<p>To capture these perspectives, we used several validated materials that can distinguish these elements of the CEPEH chatbots.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) ​[4]​ is a new questionnaire specifically designed for measuring the usability of chatbots by an interdisciplinary team from the Ulster University. CUQ can be used alongside the prevalent System Usability Scale Score (SUS) ​[5]​. Multiple metrics are more appropriate when measuring usability of chatbots ​[6]​ therefore a combination of two scores can provide an all-inclusive overview.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#utaut2-unified-theory-of-acceptance-and-use-of-technology"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The underpinning theory of the UTAUT2 is that there are four key constructs to the intentions of using technology based resources: 1) performance expectancy, 2) effort expectancy, 3) social influence, and 4) enabling conditions.</p>
<p>The TAM and the UTAUT2 have cross over in measuring technology acceptance, however the UTAUT2 has more applied probing questions. Few studies exist that use technology acceptance theories for the intention to use products that explicitly incorporate AI. A recent extension of the UTAUT2 model added five (health, convenience comfort, sustainability, safety, security, and personal innovativeness) additional influencing factors to accommodate for AI [7]. This can be used for products in either health, household use, or mobility and can help to explain behavioural intention and use behaviour of chatbots.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> System Usability Scale<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#system-usability-scale"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used [10] and is a widely used and adopted usability questionnaire.
It is popular due to its unbiased and agnostic properties, a non proprietary, and quick scale of 10 questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I think that I would like to use this system frequently.</li>
<li>I found the system unnecessarily complex.</li>
<li>I thought the system was easy to use.</li>
<li>I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.</li>
<li>I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.</li>
<li>I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.</li>
<li>I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.</li>
<li>I found the system very cumbersome to use.</li>
<li>I felt very confident using the system.</li>
<li>I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The SUS was developed with a scoring system, in which the following should be performed: For each of the odd numbered questions, subtract 1 from the score.
For each of the even numbered questions, subtract their value from 5.
Add up these numbers to find the total score, then multiply this by 2.5.
The result is a score out of 100 and can be compared against a determined average score of 68.
Further, 80.3 or higher is excellent, and 51 or under suggests significant usability problems.</p>

</h3>
<p>The 10 question CSEST was based on the 32-item questionnaire by Murphy, Coover, and Owen (1989).
Participants were provided with the facilitator stating ’Imagine you have found a new technology product that you have previously not used.
You believe this product will make your life better.
It doesn’t matter specifically what this technology product does, only that it is intended to make your life easier and that you have never used it before.
I could use the new technology…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If there was no one around to tell me what to do as I go</li>
<li>If I had never used a product like it before</li>
<li>If I had only the product manuals for reference</li>
<li>If I had seen someone else using it before trying it myself</li>
<li>If I could call someone for help if I got stuck</li>
<li>If someone else had helped me get started</li>
<li>If I had a lot of time to complete the job for which the product was provided</li>
<li>If I had just the built-in help facility for assistance</li>
<li>If someone showed me how to do it first</li>
<li>If I had used similar products before this one to do the same job</li>

<span class="header-section-number">1.4.5</span> Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#technology-acceptance-model-tam"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [1] was specifically developed with the primary aim of identifying the determinants involved in computer acceptance in general; secondly, to examine a variety of information technology usage behaviours; and thirdly, to provide a parsimonious theoretical explanatory model.
TAM suggests that attitude would be a direct predictor of the intention to use technology, which in turn would predict the actual usage of the technology.
The only modification to the nine sub-scales of the questionnaire consists of applying the items to the context of chatbots.
All the items, except those measuring attitudes, utilize a seven-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” with a middle neutral point [2].</p>
<p>The nine sub-scales of the questionnaire:</p>
<p>• Ease of use of chatbots • Perceived usefulness of chatbots • Intention of use.
• Attitude toward usage of chatbots.
• Perception of personal efficacy to use a chatbot resource.
• Perception of external control toward chatbots.
• Anxiety toward chatbot use.
• Intrinsic motivation to use chatbot resources.
• Perceived costs of chatbots.</p>

</h3>
<p>Focus groups are a pervasive means of market research and provides credible acceptance evaluators regarding the penetration that a product or service will have on a target demographic.
Focus groups are a form of qualitative research consisting of interviews or structured discussions, in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging.
Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.
During this process, the researcher either takes notes or records the vital points he or she is getting from the group.
Researchers select members of the focus group carefully for effective and authoritative responses.
Relevant stakeholders, then, can use the information collected through focus groups to receive insights on a specific product, issue, or topic focus [7].</p>
<p>A series of short focus group sessions identified the feasibility of CEPEH resources for formal curricular integration.
These sessions, spanning no more than 1-1.5 hours and consisting of no more than 5-7 persons each explored all axes of curricular integration such as accessibility in the classroom, use case scenarios, technology requirements for curricular integration etc.
These axes were formalized by the research team, in each evaluation site, to consider the curricular details of each institution.</p>

Notes for adding an opening quote in PDF output:
i) add the reference for the quote with the chunk option quote_author="my author name",
ii) include=knitr::opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex' means that these quotes are only included when output is latex (in HTML output, it would appear by the end of the previous page)
iii) You can't use markdown syntax inside chunk options, so if you want to e.g. italicise a book name in the quote reference use a 'text reference': Create a named piece of text with '(ref:label-name) My text', then link to this in the chunk option with quote_author='(ref:label-name)'
