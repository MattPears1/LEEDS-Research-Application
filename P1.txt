p1 for me personally it was really nice all of this week ive had a feeling of what chatbots were mostly because of my technical background but i really understood that there is a lot more to it and a lot more technical things a lot of applications of how you can use them not only chatbots but chatbots as well also getting the more technical look of how they work with help from the staff it was really invaluable 
p2 i barely knew what chatbots were before i had been using them once with phone provide type during the week i had been recognising lots of scenarios and similarities and examples of the chatbots  in that what would advance and facilitate by the work for teaching im providing information so for example for each course we have a canvas page and that page has 20 different modules so sometimes it can be difficult to find the information you want the benefits of the chatbot means each course can have chatbots so its easier to check for information that is relevant to their course 
and also the  glasses we have eight at the university and only few projects to use them with but we discussed some ideas of how we can use the glasses and now also this exercise of giving bad news to someone that is something that we would like to use and practise and for some people thats difficult to interact especially with medical students theyve only seen books in their lives so it would be a great way to exercise and practise social skills to work with patients as well
p3 i can only agree i did not know much about chatbots and  and im not a nontechnical person and i also think the schedule was very generous and we have a lot of spare time and we did not get too tired you really took our interests at heart at karolinska we bought a pair of  glasses and had them over a year now and no one has come up with a plan of what to do with them we have inspiration of what we can do
p4 i dont have much to add concerning chatbots but something i appreciate is the way to array of different information so despite chatbots we went through lots of topics for example bed sores so we have covered lots of information i appreciate 
p5 the chatbots are helpful for the medical records the medical history i found very helpful as we learn about it in the curriculum but we dont practise and when the time comes its difficult we would not know what to do so i found this very practical and  practise it is very nice and very helpful to us
p6 im not a technical person at all and it is something new for me i never knew technology would be so helpful i think it will promote another kind of education which is more effective and practical so yes i like it 
p7 i agree with maria i could think dentistry could be combined with informatics can you make us a clinical skills course; we do more theory than practise i was not that familiar with chatbots but i gained lots of information and it was great that we have shared ideas 

p8  its interesting i never thought it can be combined with dentistry and everything  i knew the technology has developed but the  has physical movements all of the presentations also mental health cyber security everything was interesting i would come every year  thank you for teaching me how interesting this technology is and how many different fields you can explore
p9 i didnt know much about chat bots so i have learned a lot and i found it interesting
p10 i had no idea about anything and now i think i understand the main ideas also i understand how important it is for emergencies so i am glad to be here and participate 
p11 for the seminar i had no idea about chat bots work now i know its very useful and even more popular in the future and it was really nice to have a chance to create one ourselves and have a better idea it wasnt that hard for us to create the chatbot  and we have an image of what is behind the chatbot 
p12 i think after this week ive understood that chatbots can be useful for a lot of things some small things or big things so maybe if i found something in my daily life maybe i would try to do it to myself on a wider scale project collaboration is something that can be applied especially after seeing the solutions 
p13 it would be hard to find chatbots but its good to make them as they are simple and easy to create and very useful
p14 its useful for us as the problems we have now is we have to learn everything so it would be helpful for example in first year we had medical history so it would be useful for more practical stuff the thing that stresses me out is we need to learn so many things and in other places the course is shortened as they use more simulations so  for us it may also be useful 
p15 i came up with a mental health chatbot just because i think you should help people and it would be great to help people out 
p16 can i ask a question would you make this into a short course
a yes perhaps it should be part of the curriculum of the computer science degrees definitely  but yes maybe a short course introducing new technologies 
p17 we have informatics but they dont teach us some of these things i work a lot with patient and this would be good to be on the smartphone to use it and if you learn how to use it you gain the learning objectives  
p18 when i first joined the lab they were talking about mixed reality so i asked to test it and i used it two or three times and i learned some basics and its good to use for medicine and use it as many times as you like
p19 and the beginning of the programme there were many different lectures that i definitely benefit from we can benefit from chat box into teaching and as you say students being able to recognise areas where they can benefit and if were going to have chatbots in the future then its good for everyone to know and how much time it takes to make and use them

p1 my only experience with chatbots up to now was as a customer reaching the support of a company that chatbot was very annoying but this was the fault of the company in total chatbots are interesting and useful fast they work 24/7 and you can call them any time of course they cannot substitute humans but still its a useful tool for all companies customer services 

p2 i also know chatbots from customer services only i used them a couple of times and find them also annoying only now after this workshop i know that this was the fault of the companies and the developers who didnt do good work and that chatbots can be helpful and useful if you program them well this was another interesting aspect of this workshop the developing training that showed us how we could build our own chatbot in an easy way also all the other aspects of technology that were presented here during the workshop like the neuroscience presentations or the cybersecurity ones and it was really nice that we could see and compare chatbots from different partners/universities 

p3 for me it was really interesting as a 1styear student an awakening process the fact that we understood how technology is included in current medical practice and that you should be aware of it its not possible to be a medical professional and dont know about ai  and cybersecurity aspects that are useful in modern medicine 

p4 we tried to understand how the chatbots function not from the developing aspect this sounds highly advanced but from the way we can use them; what kind of possibilities they offer to each one of us during the process we tried to “play” with them and “confuse” them and this helped us to understand more about how chatbots really work 

p5 i think that the workshop provided access to all the information about chatbots we could have more training in using rasa but i understand that this needs more time in general this workshop was very helpful  

p6 we really liked knowing about chatbots we tried to “play” with your chatbots asking difficult questions and test them hard but when we started to develop our own ones we understand how complicated they can be as we could only apply simple characteristics on them we couldnt apply friendliness etc 

coordinator its really interesting that when you refer to chatbots you dont say that they dont function well for example but rather they need more training its interesting how fast you acquired and start to use the terminology 

p7 we learned how to use the chatbot links qr codes etc it was not easy to understand well at the beginning we expected to just press a button and everything to work but gradually we understood how to use them 

p8 i used the cybersecurity chatbot and at the beginning i think it was not responding well skipped questions or so but after using it for a while i think it was trained better and worked better… 

p9 i used one of the chatbots and asked for help but it wasnt very helpful maybe i asked too many things 

p10 i liked the developing aspect of the chatbots the fact that this i a “brain” that can be trained a brain that you can input questions and answers and make it work 

p11 i liked the fact that chatbots can be both a transmitter and receiver you can get information but you can also give information through interaction i liked how you explained to us how we can train a chatbot 

p12 most of the chatbots were not “robotic” they seemed more sentimental more human…i think that chatbots should be able to interact well with humans to prove how technology can really support us 

p13 i once saw a video about chatbots mentioning that if they are super friendly people can misuse them for their own benefit 

p14 the workshop in total was very interesting and i liked all the presentations not only for chatbots but for  and neurosciences and cybersecurity 

p15 i would like to have more developing training but this is a personal view and interest i would like to learn more about the development or to develop a more complicated chatbot 

p16 i had some issues with the terminology at the beginning i didnt know what some words meant like the storyboard for example i still have this question… (an explanation about storyboard followed) 

 coordination team we should explain terminology at workshops you are right 

p17 during the development of our own chatbot we needed to have access on the platform to correct some features but this was not possible we would like to have access and try it ourselves instead of asking the administrator 

p18 i would like to use a chatbot to review my reading and for the repetition of my studying for example if the chatbot could make some questions per chapter to evaluate my reading and understanding of the topic 

p19 i would like to interact with the chatbots in the form of an illustrated test (testing my knowledge) i wouldnt like to type much i would prefer it if there was a speech to text tool 

p20 if there was a possibility to combine different information to be supported lets say for diagnosing someone this could help but just having a recapitulation at the end of the course no its not useful i can do it myself using the book 

p21 i would like if the chatbot could ask questions to test my understanding of the course and advise me on whether i should study more 

p22 i would stop using a chatbot if it doesnt understand me 

p23 i would prefer a speech to text function or uploading a photo and getting feedback and information 

p24 i wouldnt like to receive links as an answer that should lead me to other pages and search for answers there 

p25 i would like the chatbot to support me in studying by showing for example images and asking me if they are correct and then giving me links to study more 

p26 i wouldnt like anthropomorphism and sentiments for the chatbot its creepy and not needed for my studying i wouldnt like the chatbot to suggest me what to do  

coordination for ethical reasons would you like the chatbot to declare its nature from the beginning of the interaction 

p27 i would like the chatbot to state from the beginning of our conversation that it is a chatbot 

p28 i would also like to know if its a chatbot because you communicate in a different way with a chatbot or with a person 

p29 i feel that it is a security valve for the human chatbot interaction that an ethical rule would apply and the chatbot declares its nature to avoid deception 

p30 i see the chatbot as a supportive tool only to my studying 

p31 between a chatbot and a  tool i would choose  but if the chatbot could give a second opinion for a diagnosis for example i would prefer the chatbot 

p32 chatbot can give you feedback and this is why is better for me 

coordination what would you choose between a chatbot and a book 

p33 the book 

p34 the book 

p35 the book and some ppts 

p36 and some videos
