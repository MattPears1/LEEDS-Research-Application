Most learners use books or online books as resources. Of course, they
may use multiple sources however they were asked to note the primary
source. Only 6 stated their primary sources were *Online
videos/interactive materials* which includes such tools as chatbots.

```{r currently used stuff, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## table for currently used learning resources
curr <- subset(data, select = c("CurrentMaterials"))
curr <- na.omit(curr)
colnames(disc)[1] = "CurrentMaterials"

knitr::kable(curr <-curr %>% filter(CurrentMaterials %in% c("Books","Online videos/interactive material", "Online journals/books","1 to 1 workshops or lectures",format('html'))) %>% group_by(CurrentMaterials) %>% count(CurrentMaterials),"pipe")
```
This can be supported when asked the amount of time participants have
used a chatbot- in any form or subject: 23 stated they had never used a
chatbot, being educational or not. 2 individuals had spent what would be
extensive time with usage- these were the Learning Technologist and
Mature Student.

```{r previous chatbot use, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# table for previous chatbot usage

prevchat <- subset(data, select = c("Previous_Chatbot_Usage"))
prevchat <- na.omit(prevchat)
colnames(disc)[1] = "Previous_Chatbot_Usage"

knitr::kable(prevchat <-prevchat %>% filter(Previous_Chatbot_Usage %in% c("Never","1-4 hours", "5-9 hours","20+ hours","10-19 hours",format('html'))) %>% group_by(Previous_Chatbot_Usage) %>% count(Previous_Chatbot_Usage),"pipe", decreasing = TRUE)
```
## Chatbot Usabilty Questionanire (CUQ)
### CUQ Calcuation tool The CUQ was developed by researchers at Ulster University (see) {<a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/research/topic/computer-science/artificial-intelligence/projects/cuq" target="_blank">CUQ</a>}) and as the calculation can be complex a dedicated calculation tool has been created.
Please download the CEPEH CUQ calculation tool which has all of the data entered, so you can see the CEPEH CUQ scoring.

The results are as followed:

```{r cuq, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("cuq.png")

```

This scoring system was designed to be comparable to SUS and may be
freely used alongside it, or in combination with other usability
metrics. There has been evidence of correlation of 76% between the CUQ
and SUS therefore we expect the SUS scored to be between 48.75 and 81%.
We believe the CUQ has more validity towards measuring the concepts of
interest on this study.

## System Usability Scale (SUS) Scores

*Note= The amount of 'agreement' is defined as the addition of 'Agree'
and 'Strongly agree' responses.*

The SUS score should consist of 10 items. However, some SUS questions
were improved upon by 1 or more CUQ questions, specifically to this
Chatbot study. The SUS results would be overshadowed by the CUQ scores,
expect 2 that did not have cross-over. The two questions were:

-   I would like to use the CEPEH chatbot I tested, more frequently
    (SUS1)(post)
-   I felt confident using the CEPEH chatbot (SUS2)(post)

This meant the score of the SUS was not created, however the CUQ score
better represented the Learners' perceptions of the CEPEH chatbot in
terms of feasibility of reuse and acceptability in healthcare curricula.

```{r SUS table 2 questions, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# table for sus results

SUS2 <- subset(data, select = c("I would like to use the CEPEH chatbot i tested, more frequently (SUS1)(post)", "I felt confident using the CEPEH chatbot (SUS2)(post)"))
SUS2 <- na.omit(SUS2)
colnames(SUS2)[1] = "KeepUsing"
colnames(SUS2)[2] = "Confident"

library(plyr)

counts <- ddply(SUS2, .(SUS2$KeepUsing, SUS2$Confident), nrow)
names(counts) <- c("KeepUsing", "Confident", "V1")

knitr::kable(counts[order(counts$KeepUsing), ],"pipe")


```

ggplot(year, aes(year)) + geom_bar(color="purple", fill=rgb(0.2,0.3,0.9,0.7) ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2006, 2022,1)) + theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold.italic"))
```

```{r Recommend table 1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, include=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}

rec <- subset(data, select = c("Recommend","Identity"))
rec <- na.omit(rec)

knitr::kable(rec <-rec %>% filter(Identity == c("HE student","Healthcare professional", "Other", "Student","Tutor/Teacher/Lecturer","Patient/Service-user/Carer",format('html'))) %>% group_by(Identity, Recommend) %>% count(Recommend), "pipe")


```

```{r Helpful table 1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, include=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}

RLO <- subset(data, select = c("Identity","RLO Helpful"))
RLO <- na.omit(RLO)
colnames(RLO)[2] = "RLO" 
knitr::kable(RLO <- RLO %>% filter(Identity == c("HE student","Healthcare professional", "Other", format('html'), "Student","Tutor/Teacher/Lecturer", "Patient/Service-user/Carer")) %>% group_by(Identity, RLO) %>% count(RLO), "pipe")

```

if you don't like boring tables, here is the same data in a graph!

```{r barplot, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# stacked horizontal bar plot of RLO X identity 
##dataset RLOk 
RLOk <- na.omit(RLO) 

## the bar plot
ggplot(RLOk, aes(fill = RLO, x = Identity)) + geom_bar(width=0.5,position = "fill") + coord_flip() + ggtitle("How helpful has this learning object been?") + theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold.italic")) + ylab("Scale of how helpful (0-1) ") + xlab("") + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE,option = "D") 

```

## Technology Acceptance Model

The TAM had 3 sections (Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Intention
of Use). Ease of Use results showed significant increases in Users'
usage with each Chatbot. Perceived Usefulness: There were not
significant findings for the Perceived usefulness. The justification for
this may be due to being early versions of applications with limited
functionality and functions which can be difficult for user to
experience the intended further range of features and learning
exercises.

Intention of Use: For users' intentions to use within their course, the
result of the Mann-Whitney U test was not significant, U = , z = , p = .
in their intentions before use (m=xx, mode=xx) compared to after (m=xx,
mode=x), however there was improvement therefore the chatbots may have
more benefit than expected by students.

### Other Findings

Other questions

I intend to continue using chatbots in the future (BI1)

The chatbot provided the information I needed with minimal commands

My knowledge of the topic improved after i had used the Chatbot

My confidence in understanding the topic improved after I had used the
Chatbot

The chatbot provided me with the type of response i expected from asking
a tutor/lecturer

The information provided was reliable

The chatbot has a high level of trustworthiness

The duration of conversations to find my answer was too long

The videos/images provided were useful to my questions

The chatbot exceeded my expectation of how it could help me

The chatbot exceeded my expectation of how it could engage with me

I think this learning method could help me to acquire knowledge

I would use this tool again as it has some value to me

I think i will actively use this learning method

I believe i had some choice about learning during chatbot use

I would trust the chatbot to provide me with information for my course

One piece of knowledge i learned from the chatbot was..
